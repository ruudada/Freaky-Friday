        <h3>Adoption</h3>
        <p>To adopt a dog, you need to send us a "resume". Every dog deserves a caring home, and we donÂ´t want our dogs to end up in bad homes. Therefore, we have an adoption fee at 40$. This is to secure that the owner really is passionate about our dogs. After your resume has been approved, you will be free to bring your dog home.</p>
